## Stand-Alone Application  
**Definition:**  
A **Stand-Alone Application** (also known as a **Non-Server Application**) is an application that is installed and executed on a single computer, performing actions only on that computer.

## FAQ: Server-Based Applications  

### Definition  
Server-based applications are applications that run in a **server environment**. These applications are categorized into:  
1. **Web Applications**  
2. **Enterprise Applications**  

### Web Applications  
- Constructed using **Advanced Java technologies** like **JDBC, Servlets, and JSP**.  
- Typically follow a **3-tier architecture**.

### Enterprise Applications  
- Executed in a **distributed environment**.  
- Depend on features like **Security, Load Balancing, and Clustering**.  
- Follow an **n-tier architecture**.  
- **Examples:** Java Frameworks, Java Tools.

## JDBC (Part-1)  
**Definition:**  
JDBC stands for **Java Database Connectivity** and is used to interact with a database.

## FAQ: Storage and Types of Storage  

### Definition of Storage  
A **storage** is a memory location where data is available for access.  

### Types of Storage in Java  
Java applications categorize storage into four types:  
1. **Field Storage**  
   - Memory allocated for holding a **single** data value.  
   - Created when using **primitive data types** (`byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).  

2. **Object Storage**  
   - Memory allocated to store **grouped values**.  
   - Created when using **non-primitive data types** (`Class`, `Interface`, `Array`, `Enum`).
