Program Statement01:
====================
step-1 : Create the following DB Tables
StuData(stuId,stuRollNo,stuName,stuBranch)
StuAddress(stuId,stuHno,city,pincode)
StuContact(stuId,mid,phno)

step-2 :Construct Procedure to display the complete details of student based on stuId.
step-3 :Construct JDBC Application to execute Procedure.




Program Statement02:
====================
Write a Java program named CallableStatementExample that connects to a Oracle database using JDBC. The program should include the following functionalities:

Establish a connection to the database using the provided JDBC URL, username, and password.
Define a method named callFunction() that executes a stored function named getTotalEmployees in the database. This method should use a CallableStatement to call the function and retrieve the total number of employees. Print the total number of employees obtained from the function call.
Implement a main() method that demonstrates the usage of the connect() and callFunction() methods. The main() method should:
Call the connect() method to establish a connection to the database.
Call the callFunction() method to execute the stored function and retrieve the total number of employees.
Close the CallableStatement and the database connection after executing the function call.
Ensure appropriate exception handling for potential database connectivity issues and SQL errors.

Note: Replace "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe", "username", and "password" with your actual database URL, username, and password respectively. Additionally, ensure that the stored function getTotalEmployees exists in your database and returns an integer value.

Program Statement03:
====================
Step01=>Create Table:emp_info
Columns:empId,empName,empAddress,empSalary,empPhNo.
Step02: Construct Function to retrieve Employee's name based on Employee Id.
step03: Construct JDBC Application to execute function.
